《La Belle Dame sans Merci》，John Keats[http://englishhistory.net/keats/poetry/labelledamesansmerci.html]

Oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
:Alone and palely loitering?
The sedge has withered from the lake,
:And no birds sing.

Oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
:So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel's granary is full,
:And the harvest's done.

I see a lily on thy brow,
:With anguish moist and fever-dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose
:Fast withereth too.

I met a lady in the meads,
:Full beautiful - a faery's child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
:And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
:And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
:And made sweet moan.

I set her on my pacing steed,
:And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
:A faery's song.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
:And honey wild, and manna-dew,
And sure in language strange she said -
:'I love thee true'.

She took me to her elfin grot,
:And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
:With kisses four.

And there she lulled me asleep
:And there I dreamed - Ah! woe betide! -
The latest dream I ever dreamt
:On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings and princes too,
:Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried - 'La Belle Dame sans Merci
:Hath thee in thrall!'

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
:With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
:On the cold hill's side.

And this is why I sojourn here
:Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake, 
:And no birds sing.
