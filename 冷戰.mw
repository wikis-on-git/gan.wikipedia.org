{{History Of The Cold War}}
The '''Cold War''' ({{lang-ru|Холо́дная война́, ''Kholodnaya voyna''}}, 1947–91) was the continuing state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition existing after [[World War II]] (1939&ndash;1945), primarily between the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s, and the powers of the [[Western world]], particularly the [[United States]]. Although the primary participants' military forces never officially clashed directly, they expressed the conflict through military coalitions, strategic conventional force deployments, extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable, [[proxy war]]s, espionage, propaganda, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], economic and technological competitions, such as the [[Space Race]].

Despite being [[Allies of World War II|allies]] against the [[Axis powers]] and having the most powerful military forces among peer nations, the USSR and the US disagreed about the configuration of the post-war world while occupying most of [[Europe]]. The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the eastern European countries it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states, some of which were later consolidated as the [[Warsaw Pact]] (1955&ndash;1991). The US and some western European countries established [[containment]] of [[communism]] as a defensive policy, establishing alliances such as [[NATO]] to that end. 

Several such countries also coordinated the [[Marshall Plan]], especially in [[West Germany]], which the USSR opposed. Elsewhere, in [[Latin America]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the USSR assisted and helped foster [[communist revolution]]s, opposed by several Western countries and their regional allies; some they attempted to [[rollback|roll back]], with mixed results. Some countries aligned with NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and others formed the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

The Cold War featured periods of relative calm and of international high tension – the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948&ndash;1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950&ndash;1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1959&ndash;1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] (1979&ndash;1989), and the [[Able Archer 83]] NATO exercises in November 1983. Both sides sought [[détente]] to relieve political tensions and deter direct military attack, which would likely guarantee their [[mutual assured destruction]] with [[nuclear weapon]]s.

In the 1980s, the United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures against the USSR, which had already suffered [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. Thereafter, Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[perestroika]]'' ("reconstruction", "reorganization", 1987) and ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness", ca. 1985). The Cold War ended after [[History of the Soviet Union (1985&ndash;1991)|the Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power, and [[Russia]] possessing most of the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. The Cold War and its events have had a significant impact on the world today, and it is commonly referred to in popular culture.

==Origins of the term==
During [[World War II]], [[George Orwell]] used the term ''Cold War'' in the essay “You and the Atomic Bomb” published October 19, 1945, in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of nuclear war, he warned of a “peace that is no peace”, which he called a permanent “cold war”,<ref>{{cite book| last=Kort| first =Michael| title= The Columbia Guide to the Cold War|publisher= Columbia University Press| date =2001|pages =3}}</ref> Orwell directly referred to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Geiger| first =Till| title= Britain and the Economic Problem of the Cold War|publisher= Ashgate Publishing| date =2004|pages =7}}</ref> Moreover, in ''The Observer'' of March 10, 1946, Orwell wrote that “[a]fter the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a ‘cold war’ on Britain and the British Empire.”<ref>Orwell, George, ''The Observer'', March 10, 1946</ref>

The first use of the term to describe the post–World War II [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] tensions between the USSR and its satellites and the United States and its western European allies is attributed to [[Bernard Baruch]], an American financier and presidential advisor.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=54}}</ref> In South Carolina, on April 16, 1947, he delivered a speech (by journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]])<ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Safire|year=2006|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/news/edsafire.php|title=Islamofascism Anyone?|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 1, 2006|accessdate=December 25, 2008}}</ref> saying, “Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war.”<ref>'[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=2639 Bernard Baruch coins the term "Cold War"]', history.com, April 16, 1947.

There is disagreement among historians regarding the starting point of the Cold War. While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began towards the end of [[World War I]], although tensions between the [[Russian Empire]], other European countries and the United States date back to the middle of the 19th century.<ref name="Gaddis"/>

As a result of the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia (followed by its withdrawal from [[World War I]]), Soviet Russia found itself isolated in international diplomacy.<ref name="lee">{{Harvnb|Lee|1999|p=57}}</ref>  Leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a "hostile capitalist encirclement", and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided, beginning with the establishment of the Soviet [[Comintern]], which called for revolutionary upheavals abroad.<ref name="tucker34">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1992|p=34}}</ref>

Soviet relations with the West further deteriorated when, one week prior to the start of the [[World War II]], the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.<ref>Day, Alan J.; East, Roger; Thomas, Richard.

===Allies against the Axis (1941-45)===
{{see|Eastern Front (World War II)|Western Front (World War II)|Lend-Lease}}
During their joint war effort, which began thereafter in 1941, the Soviets suspected that the British and the Americans had conspired to allow the Soviets to bear the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last moment and shape the peace settlement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=151}}</ref> Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|1990|p=151–153}}</ref>

In turn, in 1944, the Soviets appeared to the Allies to have deliberately delayed the relief of the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish underground]]'s [[Warsaw Uprising]] against the Nazis.<ref>Norman Davies, "Rising'44", Pan Macmillan, 2004</ref> On at least one occasion, a Soviet fighter shot down an RAF plane supplying the Polish insurgents.<ref>Neil Orpen, "Airlift to Warsaw", University of Oklahoma Press, 1984</ref> A 'secret war' also took place between the [[SOE]]-backed [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] and [[NKVD]]-backed partisans.<ref>Norman Davies, "Rising'44", Pan Macmillan, 2004</ref>

===Beginnings of the Eastern Bloc===
{{see|Eastern Bloc}}
During the final stages of the war, the Soviet Union laid the foundation for the [[Eastern Bloc]] by directly annexing several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were initially (and effectively) ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  These included eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),<ref name="stalinswars43">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}</ref> [[Latvia]] (which became the [[Latvian SSR]])<ref name="wettig20">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref>,<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 ISBN 9789042022256</ref> [[Estonia]] (which became the [[Estonian SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> [[Lithuania]] (which became the [[Lithuanian SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> part of eastern [[Finland]] (which became the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])<ref name="ckpipe"/> and eastern [[Romania]] (which became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).<ref name="stalinswars55">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name="shirer794">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}</ref>

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe.<ref name="Telegraph">Fenton, Ben.

===Tensions build===
{{see|Long Telegram|Iron Curtain|Restatement of Policy on Germany}}
In February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]]'s "[[X Article|Long Telegram]]" from Moscow helped to articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets, and became the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennan|1968|p=292–295}}</ref> That September, the Soviet side produced the [[Nikolai Vasilevich Novikov|Novikov]] telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and "co-authored" by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability "to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kydd|2005|p=107}}</ref> 

On September 6, 1946, [[James F. Byrnes]] delivered a [[Restatement of Policy on Germany|speech]] in Germany repudiating the [[Morgenthau Plan]] (a proposal to partition and de-industrialize post-war Germany) and warning the Soviets that the US intended to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=30}}</ref> As Byrnes admitted a month later, "The nub of our program was to win the German people&nbsp;[...] it was a battle between us and Russia over minds&nbsp;[...]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daz.org/enJamesFByrnes.html|title=Southern Partnership: James F.

{{main|Containment|Truman Doctrine}}
By 1947, US president Harry S.

The American government's response to this announcement was the adoption of [[containment]],<ref name="Gaddis28">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=28–29}}</ref> the goal of which was to stop the spread of communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the [[Truman Doctrine]], which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes.<ref name="Gaddis28" /> Even though the insurgents were helped by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]],<ref name ="Lefeber 1991" /> US policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to [[Domino theory|expand]] Soviet influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=38}}</ref>

Media in the [[Eastern Bloc]] was an [[Eastern Bloc information dissemination|organ of the state, completely reliant on and subservient to the communist party]], with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party.<ref name="oneil15">{{cite book|last=O'Neil|first=Patrick|title=Post-communism and the Media in Eastern Europe|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0714647659|p=15-25}}</ref>  Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.<ref>James Wood, p. 111</ref>

===Chinese Civil War and SEATO===
{{see|Chinese Civil War|Southeast Asia Treaty Organization}}
In 1949, [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] People's Liberation Army defeated [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang's]] US-backed [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=39}}</ref> The Nationalist Government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]]. Confronted with the Communist takeover of mainland China and the end of the US atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand the [[containment]] policy.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> In [[NSC-68]], a secret 1950 document,<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 164">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=164}}</ref> the National Security Council proposed to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" />

US officials moved thereafter to expand containment into Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in order to counter revolutionary nationalist movements, often led by Communist parties financed by the USSR, fighting against the restoration of Europe's colonial empires in South-East Asia and elsewhere.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p= 212}}</ref> In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the "[[Pactomania]]"), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably [[ANZUS]] and [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]]), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases.<ref name = "Byrd" />

===Korean War===
{{main|Korean War}}
One of the more significant impacts of containment was the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. In June 1950, [[Kim Il-Sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.<ref name="Stokesbury1990">{{cite book |title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0688095135|pg=14}}</ref> To Stalin's surprise,<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings to protest that [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and not [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] held a permanent seat on the Council.<ref>{{Harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=16}}</ref> A UN force of personnel from [[South Korea]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]] and other countries joined to stop the invasion.<ref>Fehrenbach, T.

==Crisis and escalation (1953–62)==
{{Main|Cold War (1953–1962)}}
===Khrushchev, Eisenhower and De-Stalinization===
In 1953, changes in political leadership on both sides shifted the dynamic of the Cold War.<ref name= "Karabell" >Karabell, p. 916</ref> [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18&nbsp;months of the Truman administration, the US defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> 

After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the Soviet leader following the deposition and execution of [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and the pushing aside of rivals [[Georgy Malenkov]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]. On February 25, 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] by [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=107}}</ref> As part of a campaign of [[de-Stalinization]], he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.<ref name = "Karabell" />

On November 18, 1956, while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you" expression, shocking everyone present.<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html We Will Bury You!]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'', November 26, 1956. Retrieved on June 26, 2008.</ref> However, he had not been talking about nuclear war, he later claimed, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=84}}</ref> He then declared in 1961 that even if the USSR might indeed be behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, its population would be "materially provided for", and within two decades, the Soviet Union "would rise to such a great height that, by comparison, the main capitalist countries will remain far below and well behind".<ref>{{Harvnb|Taubman|2004|p=427 & 511}}</ref>

Eisenhower's secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, initiated a "[[New Look (policy)|New Look]]" for the [[containment]] strategy, calling for a greater reliance on nuclear weapons against US enemies in wartime.<ref name = "Karabell" /> Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of "massive retaliation", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression. Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" />

===Warsaw Pact and Hungarian Revolution===

From 1957 through 1961, Khrushchev openly and repeatedly threatened the West with nuclear annihilation. He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. However, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's belief in the inevitability of war, and declared his new goal was to be "peaceful coexistence".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=70}}</ref> This formulation modified the Stalin-era Soviet stance, where international [[class struggle]] meant the two opposing camps were on an inevitable collision course where Communism would triumph through global war; now, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own,<ref>{{Harvnb|Perlmutter|1997|p=145}}</ref> as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities,<ref>{{Harvnb|Njolstad|2004|p=136}}</ref> which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later "new thinking" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.<ref>Breslauer, p. 72</ref> 

US pronouncements concentrated on American strength abroad and the success of liberal capitalism.<ref>Joshel, p. 128</ref> However, by the late 1960s, the "battle for men's minds" between two systems of social organization that Kennedy spoke of in 1961 was largely over, with tensions henceforth based primarily on clashing geopolitical objectives rather than ideology.<ref>Rycroft, p. 7</ref>

===Berlin ultimatum and European integration===
During November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized "free city", giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans. Khrushchev earlier explained to [[Mao Tse-tung]] that "Berlin is the testicles of the West. Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=71}}</ref> NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.<ref>Glees, pp. 126–27</ref>

More broadly, one hallmark of the 1950s was the beginning of [[European integration]]—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.<ref>Hanhimaki, p. 312–13</ref>

===Worldwide competition===

Nationalist movements in some countries and regions, notably [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Indochina]] were often allied with communist groups—or at least were perceived in the West to be allied with communists.<ref name = "Karabell" /> In this context, the US and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as [[decolonization]] gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s;<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=121–124}}</ref> additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology.<ref>Edelheit, p. 382</ref> 

The US government utilized the [[CIA]] in order to remove a string of unfriendly Third World governments and to support allied ones.<ref name = "Karabell" /> The US used the CIA to overthrow governments suspected by Washington of turning pro-Soviet, including Iran's first democratically elected government under Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] in 1953 (''see [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]'') and Guatemala's democratically elected president [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] in 1954 (''see [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]]'').<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 164"/> Between 1954 and 1961, the US sent economic aid and military advisors to stem the collapse of [[South Vietnam|South Vietnam's]] pro-Western regime.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> 

Many emerging nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America rejected the pressure to choose sides in the East-West competition. In 1955, at the [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Conference]] in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=126}}</ref> The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1961.<ref name = "Karabell" /> Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with [[India]] and other key neutral states. Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" />

===Sino-Soviet split, space race, ICBMs===
[[Image:Space Race 1957-1975 .jpg|thumb|right|Charting the [[Space Race]] in context of [[Sputnik]] and other nuclear threats.]]
{{main|Sino-Soviet split|Space Race}}
The period after 1956 was marked by serious setbacks for the Soviet Union, most notably the breakdown of the Sino-Soviet alliance, beginning the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. [[Mao]] had defended Stalin when Khrushchev attacked him after his death in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge.<ref name="Gaddis142" /> 

After this, Khrushchev made many desperate attempts to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal.<ref name="Gaddis142">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=142}}</ref>  The Chinese and the Soviets waged an intra-Communist propaganda war.<ref>Jacobs, p. 120</ref> Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement,<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=140–142}}</ref> and the two [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|clashed militarily]] in 1969.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=149}}</ref>  

On the [[nuclear weapon]]s front, the US and the USSR pursued nuclear rearmament and developed long-range weapons with which they could strike the territory of the other.<ref name = "Byrd" /> In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM)<ref>Lackey, p. 49</ref> and in October, launched the first Earth satellite, [[Sputnik program|Sputnik]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/4/newsid_2685000/2685115.stm|title=Sputnik satellite blasts into space|publisher=BBC News|date=October 4, 1957|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the [[Space Race]].

The [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and [[History of Germany since 1945|post-World War II Germany]]. By the early 1950s, the [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement]] was emulated by most of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="dowty114">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}</ref> However, hundreds of thousands of [[East Germany|East Germans]] annually emigrated to [[West Germany]] through a "loophole" in the system that existed between East and West [[Berlin]], where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement.<ref name="harrison99">{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|p=99}}</ref> 

The emigration resulted in a massive "brain drain" from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany's population had migrated to West Germany by 1961.<ref name="dowty122">{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=122}}</ref> That June, the [[Soviet Union]] issued a new [[ultimatum]] demanding the withdrawal of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces from [[West Berlin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=114}}</ref> The request was rebuffed, and in August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the [[Berlin Wall]], effectively closing the loophole.<ref name="pearson75">{{Harvnb|Pearson|1998|p=75}}</ref>

The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=82}}</ref> It further demonstrated the concept of [[mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]], that neither nuclear power was prepared to use nuclear weapons fearing total destruction via nuclear retaliation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=80}}</ref> The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the [[nuclear arms race]] at nuclear disarmament and improving relations,<ref name = "Palmowski" /> although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], had come into force in 1961.<ref>National Research Council Committee on Antarctic Policy and Science, p. 33</ref>

In the course of the 1960s and '70s, Cold War participants struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed blocs.<ref name = "Karabell" /> From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and '60s, with [[per capita]] [[GDP]]s approaching those of the United States, while [[Eastern Bloc economies|Eastern Bloc economies stagnated]].<ref name="Karabell" /><ref name="hardt16">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=16}}</ref>

As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], combined with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the [[OPEC|Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower.<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 212"/> Moscow, meanwhile, was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems.<ref name="Karabell" /> During this period, Soviet leaders such as [[Alexey Kosygin]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] embraced the notion of [[détente]].<ref name = "Karabell" />

===Czechoslovakia invasion===
{{main|Prague Spring|Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia}}
In 1968, a period of political liberalization in [[Czechoslovakia]] called the [[Prague Spring]] took place that included "[[Action Programme (1968)|Action Program]]" of liberalizations, which described increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of movement, along with an economic emphasis on [[consumer goods]], the possibility of a multiparty government, limiting the power of the secret police<ref>Ello (ed.), Paul (April 1968).

===Brezhnev Doctrine===
[[Image:Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon talks in 1973.png|left|thumb|Brezhnev and Nixon during Brezhnev's June 1973 visit to Washington; this was a high-water mark in détente between the United States and the Soviet Union.]]
{{main|Brezhnev Doctrine}}
In September 1968, during a speech at the Fifth Congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] one month after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Brezhnev outlined the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], in which he claimed the right to violate the sovereignty of any country attempting to replace Marxism-Leninism with capitalism. During the speech, Brezhnev stated:<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 150"/>
{{quote|When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country towards capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.}}
The doctrine found its origins in the failures of [[Marxism-Leninism]] in states like Poland, Hungary and East Germany, which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany and the rest of Western Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=153}}</ref>

===Third World escalations===
{{main|Vietnam War|Operation Condor|Yom Kippur War}}
The US continued to spend heavily on supporting friendly Third World regimes in Asia. Conflicts in peripheral regions and client states—most prominently in Vietnam—continued.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=133}}</ref> Johnson stationed 575,000 troops in Southeast Asia to defeat the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] (NLF) and their North Vietnamese allies in the [[Vietnam War]], but his costly policy weakened the US economy and, by 1975, ultimately culminated in what most of the world saw as a humiliating defeat of the world's most powerful superpower at the hands of one of the world's poorest nations.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> 

Additionally, [[Operation Condor]], employed by South American dictators to suppress leftist dissent, was backed by the US, which (sometimes accurately) perceived Soviet or Cuban support behind these opposition movements.<ref>McSherry, p. 13</ref> Brezhnev, meanwhile, attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> 

Moreover, the Middle East continued to be a source of contention. Egypt, which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR, was a troublesome client, with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] (with advisers and technicians) and the [[War of Attrition]] (with pilots and aircraft) against US ally Israel;<ref>Stone, p. 230</ref> Syria and Iraq later received increased assistance as well as (indirectly) the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]].<ref>Friedman, p. 330</ref> 

During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians' behalf brought about a massive US mobilization that threatened to wreck détente;<ref>Kumaraswamy, p. 127</ref> this escalation, the USSR's first in a regional conflict central to US interests, inaugurated a new and more turbulent stage of Third World military activism in which the Soviets made use of their new strategic parity.<ref>Porter, p. 113</ref>

===Sino-American relations===
{{main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
As a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], tensions along the Chinese-Soviet border [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|reached their peak]] in 1969, and US President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to use the conflict to shift the balance of power towards the West in the Cold War.<ref>Dallek, Robert (2007), p. 144.</ref> The Chinese had sought improved relations with the US in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.

In February 1972, Nixon announced a stunning rapprochement with Mao's China<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=149–152}}</ref> by traveling to Beijing and meeting with [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]]. At this time, the USSR achieved rough nuclear parity with the US while the [[Vietnam War]] weakened US influence in the Third World and cooled relations with Western Europe.<ref>Buchanan, pp. 168–169</ref> Although indirect conflict between Cold War powers continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s, tensions were beginning to ease.<ref name = "Palmowski" />

===Nixon, Brezhnev, and détente===
[[Image:Carter Brezhnev sign SALT II.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] sign SALT II treaty, June 18, 1979, in [[Vienna]]]]
{{main|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Helsinki Accords|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe}}

Following his China visit, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, including Brezhnev in Moscow.<ref name="bbc-nb">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_4373000/4373149.stm|title=President Nixon arrives in Moscow|publisher=BBC News|date=May 22, 1972|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> These [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: [[SALT I]], the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/thelife/apolitician/thepresident/index.php|title=The President|accessdate=2009-03-27|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library}}</ref> and the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.<ref name = "Karabell" /> 

Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence" and established the groundbreaking new policy of ''[[détente]]'' (or cooperation) between the two superpowers. Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties,<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" /> including agreements for increased trade. As a result of their meetings, ''détente'' would replace the hostility of the Cold War and the two countries would live mutually.<ref name="bbc-nb"/>

Meanwhile, these developments coincided with the "[[Ostpolitik]]" of West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]].<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 154"/> Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the [[Helsinki Accords]] signed at the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=188}}</ref>

===Late 1970s deterioration of relations===
In the 1970s, the [[KGB]], led by [[Yuri Andropov]], continued to persecute distinguished Soviet personalities such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]], who were criticising the Soviet leadership in harsh terms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=186}}</ref> Indirect conflict between the superpowers continued through this period of détente in the Third World, particularly during political crises in the Middle East, [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Chile]], [[Ogaden War|Ethiopia]] and [[Angolan Civil War|Angola]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=178}}</ref> 

Although President [[Jimmy Carter]] tried to place another limit on the arms race with a [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] agreement in 1979,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/18/newsid_4508000/4508409.stm|title=Leaders agree arms reduction treaty|publisher=BBC News|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> his efforts were undermined by the other events that year, including the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.<ref name = "Lefeber 1991" />

==Second Cold War (1979–85)==
[[Image:Guerra Fria 1980.svg|thumb|right|This map shows the two essential [[sphere of influence|global spheres]] during the Cold War in 1980–the US in blue and the USSR in red. See the legend on the map for more details.]]
{{Main|Cold War (1979–1985)}}
The term ''second Cold War'' has been used by some historians to refer to the period of intensive reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militaristic.<ref name = "Halliday" /> 

===Afghanistan war===
{{main|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
During December 1979, approximately 75,000 Soviet troops [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded]] Afghanistan in order to support the Marxist government formed by ex-Prime-minister [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], assassinated that September by one of his party rivals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=210}}</ref> As a result, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] withdrew the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] treaty from the [[United States Senate|Senate]], imposed embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, demanded a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would boycott the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Moscow Summer Olympics]]. He described the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan as "the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=211}}</ref>

===Reagan and Thatcher===
In 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] defeated Jimmy Carter in the US [[United States presidential election, 1980|presidential election]], vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=189}}</ref> Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] denounced the Soviet Union and its [[ideology]]. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an "[[evil empire]]" and predicted that Communism would be left on the "[[ash heap of history]]".<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 197">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=197}}</ref> 

===Polish Solidarity movement===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981|Martial law in Poland}}
[[Pope John Paul II]] provided a moral focus for [[anti-communism]]; a visit to his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and [[nationalism|nationalist]] resurgence centered on the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] that galvanized opposition and may have led to his [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|attempted assassination]] two years later.<ref>Smith, p. 182</ref> Reagan also imposed economic sanctions on Poland to protest [[Martial law in Poland|the suppression]] of Solidarity.<ref name="Gaddis219" /> In response, [[Mikhail Suslov]], the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.<ref name="Gaddis219">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=219–222}}</ref>

===Soviet and US military and economic issues===
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|right|US and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2006]]
{{see|Brezhnev stagnation|Strategic Defense Initiative|RSD-10 Pioneer|MGM-31 Pershing}}
Moscow had built up a military that consumed as much as 25&nbsp;percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product at the expense of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and investment in civilian sectors.<ref name="LaFeber 2002, p. 332">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=332}}</ref> Soviet spending on the [[arms race]] and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least [[Brezhnev stagnation|a decade of economic stagnation]] during the late Brezhnev years. 

Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of [[nomenklatura|massive party and state bureaucracies]] dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=335}}</ref> The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their [[military-industrial complex|military–industrial base]].<ref name = "Odom">{{Harvnb|Odom|2000|p=1}}</ref> However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West.<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=340}}</ref>

By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Previously, the US had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons, but the gap had been narrowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|title=New Evidence of Moscow's Military Threat|accessdate= 2007-05-13|author=Hamm, Manfred R.|date=June 23, 1983|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Ronald Reagan began massively building up the United States military not long after taking office.

Tensions continued intensifying in the early 1980s when Reagan revived the [[B-1 Lancer]] program that was canceled by the Carter administration, produced [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/icbm/lgm-118.htm|title=LGM-118A Peacekeeper|accessdate=2007-04-10|date=August 15, 2000|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref> installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced his experimental [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], dubbed "Star Wars" by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.<ref name="ShieldSpace?">Lakoff, p. 263</ref>

With the background of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet [[RSD-10 Pioneer]] [[ballistic missile]]s targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy [[MGM-31 Pershing]] and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=202}}</ref> This deployment would have placed missiles just 10&nbsp;minutes' striking distance from Moscow.<ref>Garthoff, p. 88</ref>

On September 1, 1983, the Soviet Union shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], a [[Boeing 747]] with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], when it violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] near [[Moneron Island]] —an act which Reagan characterized as a "massacre". This act increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.<ref name="DoernerFive">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926169-5,00.html|title=Atrocity in the skies|work=Time|date=September 12, 1983|accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref> The [[Able Archer 83]] exercise in November 1983, a realistic simulation of a coordinated NATO nuclear release, has been called most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis, as the Soviet leadership keeping a close watch on it considered a nuclear attack to be imminent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=228}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Soviets incurred high costs for their own foreign interventions. Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US and other countries, waged a fierce resistance against the invasion.<ref name="LaFeber314">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=314}}</ref> The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war "the Soviets' Vietnam".<ref name="LaFeber314" /> However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system. 

A senior [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a "domestic crisis within the Soviet {{nowrap|system. ...

===Gorbachev reforms===
{{see|Mikhail Gorbachev|perestroika|glasnost}}
By the time the comparatively youthful [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] in 1985,<ref name="Gaddis 2005, p. 197"/> the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings as a result of the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.<ref name="LaFeber331" /> These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.<ref name="LaFeber331">{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=331–333}}</ref> 

An ineffectual start led to the conclusion that deeper structural changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda of economic reform called ''[[perestroika]]'', or restructuring.<ref name="Gaddis231">{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=231–233}}</ref> Perestroika relaxed the [[production quota]] system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more profitable areas in the civilian sector.<ref name="Gaddis231" />

===Faltering Soviet system===
{{see|Economy of the Soviet Union|Revolutions of 1989|Baltic Way}}
By 1989, the Soviet alliance system was on the brink of collapse, and, deprived of Soviet military support, the Communist leaders of the [[Warsaw Pact]] states [[Revolutions of 1989|were losing power]].<ref name="Gaddis 2005, pp. 235–236"/> In the USSR itself, ''glasnost'' weakened the bonds that held the Soviet Union together<ref name="Gaddis248" /> and by February 1990, with the dissolution of the USSR looming, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] was forced to surrender its 73-year-old monopoly on state power.<ref>Gorbachev, pp. 287, 290, 292</ref>

At the same time freedom of press and dissent allowed by ''glasnost'' and the festering "nationalities question" increasingly led the Union's component republics to declare their autonomy from Moscow, with the [[Baltic states]] withdrawing from the Union entirely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=253}}</ref> The [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 revolutionary wave]] that swept across Central and Eastern Europe overthrew the Soviet-style communist states, such as Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lefeber|Fitzmaurice|Vierdag|1991|p=221}}</ref> Romania being the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=247}}</ref>

Gorbachev's permissive attitude toward Eastern Europe did not initially extend to Soviet territory; even Bush, who strove to maintain friendly relations, condemned the January 1991 killings in [[January 1991 events in Latvia|Latvia]] and [[January Events|Lithuania]], privately warning that economic ties would be frozen if the violence continued.<ref>Goldgeier, p. 27</ref> The USSR was fatally weakened by a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] and a growing number of [[Republics of the Soviet Union#Soviet Union in its final state|Soviet republics]], particularly [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], who threatened to secede from the USSR. The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], created on December 21, 1991, is viewed as a successor entity to the [[Soviet Union]] but, according to Russia's leaders, its purpose was to "allow a civilized divorce" between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]] and is comparable to a loose [[confederation]].<ref>[http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/14b6b499-9eb2-4dee-b96c-784ec918969a.html Soviet Leaders Recall ‘Inevitable’ Breakup Of Soviet Union], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], December 8, 2006.

Following the Cold War, Russia cut military spending dramatically, creating a wrenching adjustment as the military-industrial sector had previously employed one of every five Soviet adults<ref name = "Aslund">Åslund, p. 49</ref>, meaning its dismantling left millions throughout the former Soviet Union unemployed.<ref name="Aslund" /> After Russia embarked on capitalist economic reforms in the 1990s, it suffered [[1998 Russian financial crisis|a financial crisis]] and a recession more severe than the US and Germany had experienced during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name = "Nolan">Nolan, pp. 17–18</ref> Russian living standards have worsened overall in the post-Cold War years, although the economy has resumed growth since 1999.<ref name="Nolan" />

The legacy of the Cold War continues to influence world affairs.<ref name = "Halliday" /> After the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the post-Cold War world is widely considered as [[Polarity in international relations#Unipolarity|unipolar]], with the United States the sole remaining superpower.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1217752.stm Country profile: United States of America]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved on March 11, 2007</ref><ref>Nye, p. 157</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blum|2006|p=87}}</ref> The Cold War defined the political role of the United States in the post-World War II world: by 1989 the US held military alliances with 50&nbsp;countries, and had 1.5&nbsp;million troops posted abroad in 117&nbsp;countries.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> The Cold War also institutionalized a global commitment to huge, permanent peacetime [[military-industrial complex]]es and large-scale [[military funding of science]].<ref name = "Calhoun">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Calhoun, Craig|encyclopedia=Dictionary of the Social Sciences|title=Cold War (entire chapter)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SvSZHgAACAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+the+Social+Sciences|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195123719}}</ref>

Military expenditures by the US during the Cold War years were estimated to have been $8&nbsp;trillion, while nearly 100,000&nbsp;Americans lost their lives in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|LaFeber|2002|p=1}}</ref> Although the loss of life among Soviet soldiers is difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost for the Soviet Union was far higher than that of the US.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=213}}</ref> 

In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' [[proxy war]]s around the globe, most notably in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=266}}</ref> Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; the incidence of interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises has declined sharply in the post-Cold War years.<ref name = "Marshall">[http://www.systemicpeace.org/PC2005.pdf Monty G.

No separate [[campaign medal]] has been authorized for the Cold War; however, in 1998, the [[United State Congress]] authorized Cold War Recognition Certificates "to all members of the armed forces and qualified federal government civilian personnel who faithfully and honorably served the United States anytime during the Cold War era, which is defined as Sept. 2, 1945 to Dec. 26, 1991." <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.hrc.army.mil/site/active/tagd/coldwar/default.htm| title=Cold War Certificate Program| accessdate=2009-10-17|format=PDF}}</ref>

The legacy of Cold War conflict, however, is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.<ref name="Halliday" /> The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by Communist governments has produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia.<ref name = "Halliday" /> In Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and a large increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].<ref name = "Halliday" />

==Historiography==
{{main|Historiography of the Cold War}}
As soon as the term "Cold War" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.<ref name = "Nashel">{{cite encyclopedia|author= Nashel, Jonathan|editor=Whiteclay Chambers, John|encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to American Military History|title=Cold War (1945–91): Changing Interpretations (entire chapter)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xtMKHgAACAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+American+Military+History|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195071980}}</ref> In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.<ref name="Brinkley">Brinkley, pp. 798–799</ref> Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.<ref name = "Halliday" />

Although explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: "orthodox" accounts, "revisionism", and "post-revisionism".<ref name = "Calhoun" />

"Orthodox" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion into Eastern Europe.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> "Revisionist" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> "Post-revisionists" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.<ref name = "Calhoun" /> Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.<ref name = "Byrd" />

The documents reflect the views of seasoned analysts who had followed closely their special areas of research and whose views were shaped in often heated debate.
